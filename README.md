### Hi there, I'm Luis!

I'm a **Bitcoin Developer** based in Canada/Mexico.
I'm transitioning from a background in construction to building the future of finance. My philosophy is simple: **High Agency & Low Time Preference.**

I don't just write code; I architect solutions using **AI Agents** (Cursor, Claude, Antigravity) to build robust, secure, and user-friendly Bitcoin tools faster than traditional workflows.
